                What is emotional AI and how does it work?
            </h1>
            <p>
                An emotional artificial intelligence (AI) or also referred to as an empathetic AI is an AI that has the
                ability to have feelings or at least behave like it has feelings. For an AI to have empathetic
                intelligence, this means that it has interpersonal, social, and people skills that help it be more
                sensitive to humans feelings and work well with them (Huang and Rust 159).

                The most recent research in emotional artificial intelligence focuses on automatic human emotion
                recognition, emotion generation and emotion augmentation. Using a combination of a person’s tone,
                speech patterns and facial expressions, an AI can use this data to infer a person’s emotions and state
                of mind. The AI then uses the inferred emotions to determine which emotion should be generated in
                response. Lastly, emotion augmentation refers to the AI’s ability to include emotion in other processes
                such as planning, reasoning, or more general goal achievement. Emotion augmentation has only been
                attempted on small-scales and is significantly less researched relative to emotion recognition and
                generation (Schuller and Schuller 41).
