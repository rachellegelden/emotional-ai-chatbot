                How could emotionally intelligent AI be used for deep-space travel? Why do the issues above need to be
                addressed before using empathetic AI in space?

                Presently, astronauts on the ISS regularly talk to psychologists on Earth and NASA ensures that there
                are doctors readily available at a moments notice to address any serious signs of distress. However,
                most of this interaction is only possible because the astronauts are in low Earth orbit and can easily
                communicate with mission control. In deep space, there are significantly longer lags in communication
                that can stretch for hours. By having an emotionally intelligent AI onboard, it could anticipate the
                needs of the crew and in real-time intervene if their mental health is at risk. Furthermore, an
                emotionally intelligent AI could act as a companion and provide empathetic support to astronauts who are
                on long-duration space missions (Patel).

                However, much more importantly, the bias in emotion recognition needs to be addressed as this could have
                serious ramifications in space travel. If emotional AI is not successful at accurately identifying the
                emotions of people of colour, the needs of those crew members could be overlooked or not be effectively
                met. When considering interstellar missions that last several generations, the lack of effective
                emotional support from an AI could mean that they are at a greater risk for significant mental health
                issues. Moreover, this could affect how successfully people of colour colonize other planets.
