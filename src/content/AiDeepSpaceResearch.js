                While AIs are in use by NASA and on the international station, all of the current AIs lack emotional
                intelligence (Patel). Currently, CIMON (Crew Interactive MObile CompanioN), an eleven pound robot on the
                ISS that can converse with astronauts. Developed through a partnership between German space agency DLR,
                Airbus and IBM, CIMON is approximately the size of a medicine ball and can independently travel around
                the European Columbus Research Module of the ISS. Its original purpose was to act as an assistant for
                astronauts by helping them with their experiments and other work for their mission. Looking forward, the
                IBM project lead Matthias Biniok says that they plan to incorporate emotional intelligence to CIMON in
                order to make it a real astronaut companion and a more effective assistant (CIMON brings AI to the
                International Space Station). CIMON-2, an updated version of CIMON was sent to the ISS in December of
                2019 (CIMON-2 makes its successful debut on the ISS).

                Another AI that is under development with the aim of helping astronauts with space travel is Henry the
                Helper. Henry the Helper is an AI that is being developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab who has partnered
                with Akin, an Australian tech firm. Henry is a knee high rover who is being designed to help people
                build spacecraft. The CEO of Akin, Liesl Yearsley says that in the future they would like to advance
                Henry’s role to include advanced problem solving and being emotionally intelligent and able to support
                humans’ wellbeing (Australia Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources).
